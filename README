Special Instructions: 

To run this program:

python3 schedSim.py <filename> -p <ALGORITHM> -q <QUANTUM>
----------------------------------------------------------
Assuming the job file will always be the first argument.
The options (-p and -q) can be taken in any order.

Answers to Questions:
    1. If burst times increase with each scheduled job, the turnaround times for SRTN and FIFO will
       be identical. Also, if all job burst times are identical, then turnaround times will be identical as well.
    2. If the quantum value is equal to the burst times of all jobs, then response times for
       SRTN and RR are identical, since turnaround times and wait times are also identical in this case.
    3. As job times increase, response times also increase. However we cannot demonstrate
       this in our simulator directly, since we finish the execution of all jobs before 
       printing out the entire output. If we instead printed out the jobs as they were executed in real
       time, we could demonstrate this.
    4. As the quantum time increases, so does the response time for RR. 
       Worst-case equation given N jobs: ((N - 1) * q) / N
